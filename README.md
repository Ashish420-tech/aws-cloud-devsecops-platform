# 🚀 AWS Cloud DevSecOps Platform

An **end-to-end DevSecOps implementation on AWS** demonstrating Infrastructure as Code, CI/CD automation, container security scanning, Kubernetes deployment, and monitoring.

This project simulates a **real-world DevOps workflow used in production environments**.

---

# 📌 Project Overview

This project builds a **secure cloud-native application platform** using AWS and DevOps best practices.

The system automatically:

• Builds container images
• Scans code and containers for vulnerabilities
• Deploys applications to Kubernetes
• Monitors application health and metrics

---

# 🧱 Architecture

Developer → GitHub → CI/CD Pipeline → Security Scans → Docker Build → ECR → EKS → Monitoring

Main workflow:

1. Developer pushes code to GitHub
2. CI/CD pipeline triggers automatically
3. Security scans run on code and containers
4. Docker image is built and pushed to Amazon ECR
5. Application is deployed to Amazon EKS
6. Monitoring stack collects metrics and logs

# 🚀 Latest Update: AWS 3-Tier Architecture (Manual Deployment)

## 📌 What I Built

Designed and deployed a **production-like scalable 3-tier architecture on AWS** to gain hands-on experience with real-world infrastructure and networking.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Components

* **VPC** with public & private subnets
* **Internet Gateway & NAT Gateway**
* **EC2 Instances**

  * Frontend (Public subnet)
  * Backend (Private subnet)
* **RDS MySQL Database** (Private subnet)
* **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**
* **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)**

---

## 🔐 Security Design

* Backend instances are **not publicly accessible**
* Database is fully isolated in **private subnet**
* Only ALB is exposed to the internet
* Access controlled via **Security Groups**

---

## ⚙️ Key Features Implemented

* NAT Gateway for private subnet internet access
* Backend communication using private IP
* Spring Boot backend connected to RDS
* ALB routing traffic to backend instances
* Auto Scaling based on CPU utilization

---

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

* Verified backend API via ALB endpoint
* Inserted and retrieved data from RDS
* Simulated CPU load to test Auto Scaling
* Troubleshot real issues (NAT, routing, SSH, DB connectivity)

---

## 📸 Screenshots

> Add screenshots:

* ALB endpoint output
* Auto Scaling instances
* RDS connection
* Architecture diagram (optional)

---

## 🎯 Outcome

This phase helped me deeply understand:

* AWS networking (VPC, routing, NAT)
* Private vs public architecture design
* Load balancing and scaling
* Real-world debugging scenarios
